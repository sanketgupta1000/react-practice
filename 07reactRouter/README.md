# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Need of router

We know that react creates single page applications (SPAs). So, by itself, react cannot change the url. If we want to do so, so as to increase UX. We can use react-router-dom.

# Installation of react-router-dom

Refer to the docs of react router

# Special components in react-router-dom

- Link: used in place of anchor tag, since anchor reloads the page completely.
- NavLink: used as a navbar link. Provides additional features (such as link highlighting based on url) that are explored in this project
