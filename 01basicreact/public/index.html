<!-- This is the file that is sent to browser.
    But wait, there's nothing in this file except a noscript tag and an empty div. How does our application display things then?
    The answer lies in the fact that this file is not sent as it as to the client. 
    First, during the build step (either building for production or development),
    'bundled' javascripts are injected in this file.
    Two of those are our App.js and index.js (not exactly, they are also change before) from src folder.
    Try to test it all! -->

    <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.
